    <span style="text-align:center;" class="info">This piece of art was created by Yayoi Kusama, and consists of a number of pumpkins scattered around a room. In the background are mirrors, which causes the viewer to believe that the number of pumpkins is close to infinite. The purpose of this exhibit, as stated by the Dallas Museum of Art, to have "visitors ... step inside the mirrored space and fully immerse themselves in Kusamaâ€™s creation, becoming part of the art."</span>
