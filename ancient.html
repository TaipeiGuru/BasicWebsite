      Art is one of the most oldest markings of humans on earth. Art can be traced back to around 700,000 B.C.E., older than the oldest civilizations. Art precedes even the modern human species; the first homo sapiens appeared in Africa between 300,000 and 200,000 B.C.E., making art twice as old as modern humans.The oldest piece of art ever discovered was a number of petroglyphs, found in India. These petroglyphs are named the Bhimbetka and Daraki-Chattan Petroglyphs, after their location (a cave in Bhimbetka and a rock shelter at Daraki-Chattan). They consist of cupules (concave depressions) in the rock.

      Some of the oldest paintings in the world date back to around 39,000 B.C.E. One well-known example is the El Castillo cave paintings, located on the northern coast of Spain. It's unclear whether the El Castillo paintings were created by neanderthals or homo sapiens, as the paintings are dated back to a time when neanderthals were becoming extinct and homo sapiens were just starting to roam the Earth.
